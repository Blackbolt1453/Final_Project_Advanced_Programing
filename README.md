Object-oriented programming is a programming model in which software design is organized around data or objects, rather than using functions and logic. Focusing on the objects that programmers need to manipulate, rather than focusing on the logic necessary for that manipulation. As our final project in the subject of Advanced Programming, we created a repository in GitHub that includes some codes created throughout the August-December 2023 semester where the main topic is object-oriented programming within C++. However, the project does not end with just creating a repository and uploading its respective codes. In addition to this, within the repository, a branch was made where code from the repository will be included with some additional modifications. Once the recurring modifications were made, a pull request was made to save the changes made to the repository.
